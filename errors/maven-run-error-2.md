The error messages you are encountering indicate that your `pom.xml` file is malformed. Specifically, Maven is expecting a proper XML structure, including required elements such as `<project>`, `<modelVersion>`, `<groupId>`, `<artifactId>`, and `<version>`. However, it seems that the root element is incorrectly set to `<build>`.

### Steps to resolve the issue:

1. **Open the `pom.xml` File**:
   Open your `pom.xml` file in a text editor or IDE to check its contents. You can use the following command to open it in `nano`:
   ```bash
   nano pom.xml
   ```

2. **Ensure the Correct XML Structure**:
   Make sure your `pom.xml` starts with the correct structure. Below is a template for a basic Spring Boot `pom.xml` file:

   ```xml
   <project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
            xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
            xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
       <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>

       <groupId>com.example</groupId>
       <artifactId>spring-boot-hello-world</artifactId>
       <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
       <name>spring-boot-hello-world</name>
       <description>Demo project for Spring Boot</description>
       <parent>
           <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
           <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
           <version>2.5.4</version>
           <relativePath/> <!-- lookup parent from repository -->
       </parent>

       <properties>
           <java.version>17</java.version>
       </properties>

       <dependencies>
           <dependency>
               <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
               <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
           </dependency>
       </dependencies>

       <build>
           <plugins>
               <plugin>
                   <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
                   <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
               </plugin>
           </plugins>
       </build>
   </project>
   ```

3. **Replace or Modify Your Existing `pom.xml`**:
   Ensure your `pom.xml` includes all the necessary elements as shown in the template. Adjust the `groupId`, `artifactId`, and `version` according to your project's naming conventions.

4. **Save Changes**:
   After making the necessary changes, save the file and exit the editor. In `nano`, you can save by pressing `CTRL + O`, then `Enter`, and exit with `CTRL + X`.

5. **Run the Spring Boot Application Again**:
   Now, try running your Spring Boot application again:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

Following these steps should resolve the issues with your `pom.xml` file and allow you to successfully run your Spring Boot application.
